## Get Involved

This project is currently in the "proof-of-concept" stage and does not support many browsers or web sites. I am committed to improving this rapidly, but I could use your help.

### 1. Help test the extension

If your browser is listed above, please install the extension and test it out on the supported sites.

If you want to know what it's doing, you can enable debug mode in the extension settings. In this mode, content that would normally be removed by the extension is highlighted in red instead. If the extension is not working properly, please [open an issue][0]. Please include your browser name and version, the site you were on, and a screenshot with enough information to reproduce the search you did.

### 2. Vote for your favorite browsers and sites

If you use a browser or a travel site that is not listed above, please [open an issue][0] to request it if there's not already an [existing issue][1]. If there is an existing issue, vote for it by [adding a thumbs up][2].

### 3. Help fix bugs, port the extension to a different browser, or add support for a new site

If you are technically savvy and willing to help, please fork the project and send pull requests. I'll happily review your work and give as much guidance as I can. In your pull request, feel free (but not obligated) to also add your name to the Contributors list below.
